> TLDR: I‚Äôve made some good progress in my first week, I need to tidy a few bits up and would like to start looking at applying some patterns, but I‚Äôm happy with what I have achieved so far. Take a look at the [end of week one section to see the final code](#end-of-week-one).

I‚Äôve just completed my first week learning React by building an application and it has gone better than expected üëê

This post is more of a run-through of *what* I spent my week working on rather than a guide to *how* I did it.


## The plan

The plan at the start of the week looked like this

- Get a basic app up and running in CodeSandbox
- Break sections of the markup into components: filters, coins etc
- Add some state to track collected coins and apply filters
- Look into database options

I also set myself a few stretch goals

- Retrieve data from a database
- Set up continuous integration
- Look into unit testing best practices in React

## What features will be in the first iteration?

[Last week I decided](/learn-react-by-building-a-web-app/#what-am-i-going-to-build) the first iteration of the app will

- Display a list of coins
- Group coins according to their denomination (¬£1, ¬£2, etc)
- Provide a way for the user to mark a coin as ‚Äúcollected‚Äù
- Have filters for coin denomination, showing ‚Äúowned‚Äù coins, and showing ‚Äúcoins needed‚Äù
- Require users to log in so that their data can be saved to a database (stretch)


## Choosing a name

Before I could start creating the project I had to come up with a name. I needed a name which isn't in use in any of the app stores already and something which is easy to remember. I came up with Coinsly, which is nice and short and sound "app like".


## Starting out

As I mentioned last week, I started by using [the Create React App sandbox on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/new), this provided a great starting point ‚Äî no adding npm dependencies, configuring webpack config, or setting up linting tasks.

My thinking was that If Create React App becomes too restrictive then I‚Äôll run the eject task so I can tweak the config in any way I see fit. I‚Äôm hoping I won‚Äôt have to do that for a while yet as I‚Äôd like to stay focused on building the app rather than having to dig into webpack configuration.


## Component details

There are a few conventions which I picked up and used throughout my components.

### Arrow functions on class properties

I started using [arrow functions on class properties](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/) for event handler functions quite early on as it means that you do not have to bind the context for the function in the constructor.

So rather than this:

```js
class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.handleFilterSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleFilterSubmit () {
    ...
  };
}
```

You can do this instead:

```js
class App extends Component {
  handleFilterSubmit = e => {
    ...
  };
}
```

Much clearer and less code to write.

### Types of components

There are a few styles you can use to write components in React, I used two of the most common; class and stateless functional components. I‚Äôll describe where I used each in the component details below.

### PropTypes

PropTypes were added to each component to ensure that while developing the app the correct required & optional props were being passed. This saved me a lot of headaches as DevTools shows a warning when you forget to pass a prop or pass the wrong type.

### Async/Await

Create React App supports async/await out of the box so I went ahead and used the feature in place of the promise syntax across the entire codebase.


## The components

Right, on with the component details!

[Based on my plan above](#what-features-will-be-in-the-first-iteration) I figured that I‚Äôd need five components in total. I‚Äôll describe each one in detail below starting with the lowermost child and working up.

### Coin Component

This is a stateless functional component which displays details for an individual coin as well as providing a way for the user to mark the coin as collected.

<a id="coin-component-props" aria-hidden="true"></a>

#### Props

- `coin` - object containing all of the details of a single coin.
- `owned` - an array of all of the coins the user has marked as ‚Äúowned‚Äù. Has a default value of `[]`.
- `handleOwnedChange` - this function is called when a coin is marked as ‚Äúowned‚Äù. It updates the `owned` property in state.

Not much to say about this component other than it sets the `checked` property of the owned checkbox by looking up the coin ID in the `owned` state:

```html
<input
  ...
  checked={owned.find(o => o.coinId === coin.id) !== undefined}
/>
```

### Filters component

This is a stateless functional component which contains the filter elements allowing the user to filter which coins are visible.

#### Props

`filter` - a string which is set to the current filter. Has a default value of `‚Äòall‚Äô`.
`handleSubmit` - function which is called when submitting the filters form. It updates the `filter` property in state.
`handleChange` - this function is called when selecting a filter. It sets the `filter` property in state.


### CoinList component

This is a stateless functional component which handles filtering and displaying the list of coins. Each coin in the filtered list is passed to the `Coin` component to display.

If there are no coins to display then a message is shown to the user.

#### Props

- `coins` - an array of all the coins before any filters have been applied. Has a default value of [].
- `owned` - an array of all of the coins the user has marked as ‚Äúowned‚Äù. Has a default value of [].
- `filter` - a string which is set to the current filter.
- `handleOwnedChange` - function which is [passed down and used in the Coin component](#coin-component-props).
- `handleSubmit` - function which is called when submitting the coin list form.

There are three functions which sit alongside this component; `filterCoins`, `filterNeeded`, and `filterOwned`.

The `filterCoins` function calls one of the other two methods based on the filter string passed to it, if the filter is `‚Äòall‚Äô` then it returns the coin list unfiltered. The other two methods do what you would expect; `filterNeeded` returns the coins which the user has marked as needed; and `filterOwned` returns the coins which the user has marked as ‚Äúowned‚Äù.

I‚Äôm not completely happy with these functions living in the same file as the `CoinList` component so I‚Äôll most likely move them out into a helper module in the future, that way I can unit test the logic a little easier.

### Header component

The header component a stateless functional component which displays the app title at the top of the page.

#### Props

- `title` - the name of the app.

### App component

The top-level component which holds state as well as passing down event handlers to child components. `App` is a class component as it holds state and makes use of the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method to handle authentication events and loading data.

#### Initial State

These have mostly already been covered in the component details above but I‚Äôll add descriptions again here for reference.

- `user` - object containing the logged-in users‚Äô details.
- `isLoading` - boolean which handles displaying a loader indicator to the user.
- `coins` - an array of all the coins before any filters have been applied.
- `owned` - an array of all of the coins the user has marked as ‚Äúowned‚Äù
- `filter` - a string which is set to the current filter. Values can be `‚Äòall‚Äô`, `‚ÄòonlyNeeded'`, or `‚ÄòonlyOwned‚Äô`.

#### `componentDidMount()`

Once the component has mounted an event listener is added which checks for firebase authentication changes (more on this in the next section). Once it detects that a user has logged in then it‚Äôll go off and load the coin and owned data and add that to state.

#### `login()` & `logout()`

These two functions call firebase to handle the authentication steps. login will add the user details into state, and logout will reset state back to its initial ..state?!

#### `Render()` method

This is where we tell React how we want all of the imported components to be displayed and which props we‚Äôd like to pass to each.

I made use of conditional logic a fair bit here, for example the loading indicator is display if the `state.isLoading` is true:

```js
{ this.state.isLoading && <p>Loading</p>}
```

React will [only render the HTML if this.state.isLoading has a truthy value](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#booleans-null-and-undefined-are-ignored).

### Index

Not actually a component but included here for completeness; this is the entry point for the app where we tell React where and what it should render.

It also calls a firebase service which I‚Äôll talk about the next section.


## Firebase ‚Äî Stretch goal!

I‚Äôve looked into hosted database options for web apps in the past and have always felt like there was a mountain of things to learn and loads of config to set up before you could even start looking at displaying data from a database in your app.

Then, whilst looking the source code for [Kent C. Dodds‚Äô Repeat TODO app](https://github.com/kentcdodds/repeat-todo-v2), I noticed he was using Firebase so I decided to check it out.

The first thing I did was look for a good tutorial online, I found one on [CSS Tricks called Intro to Firebase and React by Simon Bloom](https://css-tricks.com/intro-firebase-react/). Following the steps in the article, I had an app which queried a database for data and authentication set up within 30 minutes.

Following this, I decided to add a [Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/) to my app. Firestore is in beta but it seemed to fit the app spec better than the real-time datastore, plus the costs appear to be less. It‚Äôs also heavily documented and, so far, I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it.

### Adding data

I wanted to add a subset of the coin data to the database, so first I created a `firebaseService.js` module which exposes the Firestore database object:

```js
import firebase from 'firebase';

export const db = firebase.firestore();
```

Then I created `coinService.js` which imported the database object and contained a function which could add one coin to the store at a time:

```js
import { db } from './firebaseService';

export const addCoin = async ({ denomination, name, year, order }) => {
  const result = await db
    .collection('coins')
    .add({ denomination, name, year, order });
};
```

I passed my coin data to this function one coin at a time until it was all added, which took less than a second!

### Building up the services

Next, I created a few other services to handle retrieving and adding data for the ‚Äúowned‚Äù coins list and user details.

This took a while as I had to reference the Firestore documentation a fair bit to get things working as I wanted them to.

All of the calls to the database use promises so I took the opportunity to use async/await everywhere.

### Coin data structure

The data structure for the coins looks like this:

```js
{
  denomination: string,
  name: string,
  year: number,
  order: number
}
```

### Owned coins data structure

The data structure for ‚Äúowned‚Äù coins looks like this:

```js
{
  coinId: string,
  userId: string
}
```

`coinId` is the ID of the coin record, and `userId` is the ID of the user, simple! When a user is signed in I retrieve all of the records which have the users‚Äô ID and then match those records against the coins displayed using the `coinId`.

### User data structure

The data structure for owned coins looks like this:

```js
{
  userId: string,
  displayName: string,
  email: string,
  photoURL: string,
  creationTime: string,
  lastSignInTime: string
}
```

The reason I added a `userId` property rather than use the generated database ID was that when using a sign-in provider an ID is passed back when the user logs in and I wanted to use that ID to retrieve a record form the database.


## Unit tests ‚Äî Stretch goal!

I really wanted to start looking into unit testing best practices in React at this point, and coincidentally [Kent C. Dodds had just sent out a newsletter which covered a new unit testing library which he just released](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library) which is *‚Äúa very light-weight solution for testing React components‚Äù*. At this point you may have realised I am a huge fan of Kent and his work!

I followed the readme on the GitHub repository and wrote a couple of basic tests but left it at that point as I feel like I need to do some more reading up on writing React unit tests.


## Continuous integration ‚Äî Stretch goal!

[I set up a TravisCI build](https://travis-ci.org/DamianMullins/Coinsly) which runs the `yarn build` and `yarn test` tasks against NodeJS versions 7, 8, and 9 whenever changes are push to the GitHub repository.

It also [pushes the unit test coverage report up to Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/DamianMullins/Coinsly) after a successful test run, my hope is that these reports will spur me on to write more tests and get the coverage up!


## Issues

It wasn‚Äôt all plain sailing this week, I did hit a few issues along the way. Mostly due to me misunderstanding React concepts and best practices.

### State woes

I spent far too long trying to access state set in the `App` component in the children components, completely forgetting that state is private to a component ü§¶

Once I (finally) remembered that state in React is private to the component it is defined in I passed the data down to the children components vis `props`.

### Filter logic

I fumbled with the format of the filter state for a while, originally I had each filter type as a separate property in state:

```js
{
  all: true,
  onlyNeeded: false,
  onlyOwned: false
}
```

The filter elements were checkboxes which were a poor choice as it meant that when a filter was selected I had to call a function which set the active/inactive values for the state properties, and those states were applied to the `checked` attribute of each checkbox.

This clearly wasn‚Äôt going to scale well if I wanted to add more filters in the future as I‚Äôd have to create a new property in state and then update the function to see which filter was currently active.

To get around this I created a single property called `filter` in state which holds a string description of the current filter to be applied:

```js
{
  filter: ‚Äòall‚Äô
}
```

Then I switched the checkboxes to radio buttons and grouped them together using the `name` attribute ‚Äî this is standard HTML,  nothing React specific here.

Each radio button then sets the `checked` attribute based on the filter state value

```html
<input
  ...
  checked={filter === 'all'}
/>
```

### Snapshot testing in CodeSandox

Whilst writing a unit test which used `.toMatchSnapshot()` I hit an issue in CodeSandbox where it can‚Äôt create snapshot files.

To get around this I had to clone the repository onto my laptop and run the unit tests with the `-u` flag (`yarn run tests -u`) in order to create the snapshot files, then check the updated files in. Once this was done the tests passed in CodeSandbox.

### Prop drilling

At the end of the week I ended up with most of the app logic and all of the handler functions defined in the `App` component which means that there is lots of prop drilling happening in order to pass state and event handlers down to child components.

Next week I plan to do some reading up on this subject and how best to resolve this.


<a id="end-of-week-one" aria-hidden="true"></a>

## End of week one

Below is the source code for the app as it stands at the end of the first week.

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/6vp397pr3z?autoresize=1&module=%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FApp.js&view=editor" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>

So, I feel like I‚Äôve made some good progress in my first week, I even managed to work on all of the stretch goals! The app is far from finished and I need to tidy a few bits up, but I‚Äôm happy with what I have achieved so far.

Also, it doesn‚Äôt look great at the moment as I‚Äôve not come up with a design and haven‚Äôt written any styles but that is something else which I‚Äôd like to figure out what this CSS in JS thing is all about.

I‚Äôm sure over the next few weeks and months I‚Äôll be refactoring and removing all of the uneducated pieces of code I‚Äôve written so far, we‚Äôll have to wait and see.

Until next week ‚úåÔ∏è

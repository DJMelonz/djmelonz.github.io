        <p class="post-date">Posted <time datetime="2016-01-29T17:01:00">29th January 2016</time>

            
        </p>
        
        <p>Exactly one year ago I wrote a post looking ahead to 2015 in which I made plans and set a few goals for the year ahead. What a year it&#39;s been.</p>
<h2 id="2015">2015</h2>
<p>I entered 2015 having just gotten engaged to my girlfriend Charlotte, this was shortly followed by the wonderful news that Charlotte was pregnant! The majority of the year was spent preparing for the imminent arrival of a newborn baby. Forrest Indie John Mullins was born in September, this was a life changing experience and one which has changed me in many ways in a short space of time (getting used to lack of sleep being one of them!), I&#39;m looking forward to watching him grow up and spending as much time as I can with my family.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had an incredible year at Just Eat, working with a lot of very talented people on some incredible projects, I&#39;m looking forward to more of the same in 2016. </p>
<p>My podcast obsession has grown over the course of the year, my commute into work takes around two hours each day; perfect for listening to lots of podcasts!</p>
<p>To keep up to date with the latest news on the web I subscribe to a number of email newsletters, this has inspired me to create my <a href="/newsletter">newsletter named <em>Need Input</em></a> which I send out weekly to small number of subscribers. The great thing about putting this together is that it forces me to actually read a lot of articles rather than saving them to Pocket where they usually sit unread forevermore.</p>
<h3 id="tech">Tech</h3>
<p>On the tech front I did manage to play around with a lot of code, some of which was es6 which was great, I have entered 2016 with a fair degree of confidence that I can begin writing es6 code which is suitable to go into a production website, great! I didn&#39;t spend a lot of time experimenting with frameworks like Aurelia which is a shame, but as the project has matured a lot more now I think now is a much better time to jump in.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>The list of books I challenged myself to read changed slightly over the course of the year, I managed to read <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/git-in-practice">Git in practice</a>, <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it">Release it!</a>, <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/javascript-application-design">JavaScript application design</a>, and <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/soft-skills">Soft skills</a> from the list, that&#39;s a third right there. I then went off plan and read <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/the-art-of-unit-testing-second-edition">The Art of Unit Testing, Second Edition</a>, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781939902146.do">Developing a gulp Edge: The Streaming Build System</a>, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920039303.do">You Don&#39;t Know JS: Up &amp; Going</a> and <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026327.do">You Don&#39;t Know JS: Scope &amp; Closures</a>, and am currently reading <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033738.do">You Don&#39;t Know JS: this &amp; Object Prototypes</a>. I don&#39;t think I did too bad really, it was quite an ambitous goal.</p>
<p>As well the books above I was reading the <a href="http://stephenking.com/darktower/book/">Stephen King Dark Tower series</a>, and more recently have started reading the <a href="http://www.ianfleming.com/books/">James Bond series</a>.</p>
<p>I also have an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/modernagecomic/">ever growing collection of comics</a>.</p>
<h3 id="blog">Blog</h3>
<p>The blog didn&#39;t recieve much attention from me last year, with only three posts, I struggled to find time and motivation which wasn&#39;t great. </p>
<h2 id="2016">2016</h2>
<p>So, 2016.. Rather than setting specific goals like I did last year, this year I&#39;m going to set myself a small number of general goals to guide me instead.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-frontend-development">Focus on frontend development</h3>
<p>Working the full stack is great, however this year I&#39;m going to focus on frontend development as it&#39;s where I have much more experience and feel that I could give much more back to the open source community as well as work colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="write-more">Write more</h3>
<p>It&#39;s easy to always set myself this goal, this year I&#39;m going to really focus and see how I get on. Following the recent overhaul of my blog I seem to have been bitten by the writing bug once more, having posted three times already this month, go me! Smaller focused posts appear to be the way forward.</p>
<h3 id="get-out-more">Get out more</h3>
<p>Lunch breaks aren&#39;t for working on personal projects! I&#39;m really bad at sitting at my desk and not taking regular breaks, which can really put you in an odd mood once you&#39;re reintroduced to the real world, as well as brand you as the anti-social workaholic..! </p>
<hr>
<p>Once again, same as last year; wish me luck! </p>
